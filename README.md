# jaxus
Ultrasound beamforming and processing in JAX.

## Installation
### Installation via pip
```bash
pip install .
```
or if you want to install in editable mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```
### Including as a subfolder
You can also include this repository as a subfolder in your project. In this case we need to add an __init__.py file in the root of the jaxus repo. The bash script `install_as_subfolder.sh` does this for you. You can run it by:
```bash
bash install_as_subfolder.sh
```
